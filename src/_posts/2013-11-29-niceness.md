I'm here in Park City with my girlfriend [Christine](http://tine.ms.mixture.io) visiting my dad. Right now we're watching some Penn State football (his alma mater). Hackenberg just made a 59-yard touchdown pass, he's 20-27 in passing today and leading a big upset over Wisconsin - in other words dad's excited.

Yesterday we were watching the local news and they did a special story on Brylee Olson and her family, Brylee has a esrious tumour on her brainstem. The story is online if you want to read it at [Desert News](http://www.deseretnews.com/interactive/2013/brylees-wings/).

Now I'm planning on building a twisted/flask benchmark to compare firsthand the load/perf benefits for async and sync frameworks...

TODO

GET /primes/n

# using deferreds and nested generators
method_get(request):
    d.addCallback(get_primes(n), errback)
    return d.result()

# I forget flask's method offhand, but roughly
route_get():
    return get_primes(n)

also.. TODO
* Do more greenlet tests
* organize my ipython scripts
