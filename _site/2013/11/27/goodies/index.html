<p>recently i started using mixture to build a <a href='http://tine.ms.mixture.io'>site for my gf</a>. it&#8217;s pretty simple and cute.</p>

<p>But at the same time I was doing some angular work and wanted to use grunt, yo and bower:</p>

<ul>
<li>ha, markdown won&#8217;t create a li for the next item without this existing</li>

<li><a href='http://www.sitepoint.com/kickstart-your-angularjs-development-with-yeoman-grunt-and-bower/'>angularjs + grunt + yo + bower ist rad</a></li>
</ul>

<p>wtfnote to self re markdown: funny that &#8220;some angular work\n* blah&#8230;&#8221; didn&#8217;t result in an unordered list being started, but &#8220;work\n\n&#8221; did. This is inconsistent with note to self: brackets are weird in markdown. hurrah</p>

<ul>
<li>angular-leaflet: https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet</li>

<li>http://heldr.github.io/bower-components/</li>

<li>http://underscorejs.org/#</li>
</ul>

<p>then i recalled a mental note to test out jekyll also. and hence this, an experiment with jekyll. which in turn brings me to yaml and markdown. yet more random shit.</p>

<p>then i came across mixture simple mode and thought to give it a spin considering i paid for it&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://benjamin.parry.is/writing/running-jekyll-with-mixture/'>run jekyll and mixture</a></li>

<li><a href='http://thanpol.as/jekyll/jekyll-and-livereload-flow/'>run jekyll and livereload</a></li>
</ul>

<p>thoughts on mixture simple mode w/jekyll or grunt projects&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>it does minification and pre-processing, which is nice. But frankly who cares for a blog?</li>

<li>mixture is unable to do live-refresh, which suddenly seems like the only thing I&#8217;d care about.</li>

<li>result: not sure it&#8217;s worth the overhead</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so here are some actually interesting things</p>

<li>es6 harmony - generators http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators</li>

<li>monkey patching generators http://bjouhier.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/bringing-asyncawait-to-life-in-javascript/</li>
</ul>

<p>Did I tell you that test coverage tools are amazing?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='https://coveralls.io/'>like coveralls</a></li>

<li>wonder if there&#8217;s a <a href='https://gemnasium.com/'>gemnasium</a> for pip? found a mention for bundlescout, but it seems <a href='http://www.bundlescout.com/'>down</a></li>
</ul>
