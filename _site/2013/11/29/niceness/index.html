<p>I&#8217;m here in Park City with my girlfriend <a href='http://tine.ms.mixture.io'>Christine</a> visiting my dad. Right now we&#8217;re watching some Penn State football (his alma mater). Hackenberg just made a 59-yard touchdown pass, he&#8217;s 20-27 in passing today and leading a big upset over Wisconsin - in other words dad&#8217;s excited.</p>

<p>Yesterday we were watching the local news and they did a special story on Brylee Olson and her family, Brylee has a esrious tumour on her brainstem. The story is online if you want to read it at <a href='http://www.deseretnews.com/interactive/2013/brylees-wings/'>Desert News</a>.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m planning on building a twisted/flask benchmark to compare firsthand the load/perf benefits for async and sync frameworks&#8230;</p>

<p>TODO</p>

<p>GET /primes/n</p>

<h1 id='using_deferreds_and_nested_generators'>using deferreds and nested generators</h1>

<p>method_get(request): d.addCallback(get_primes(n), errback) return d.result()</p>

<h1 id='i_forget_flasks_method_offhand_but_roughly'>I forget flask&#8217;s method offhand, but roughly</h1>

<p>route_get(): return get_primes(n)</p>

<p>also.. TODO</p>

<ul>
<li>Do more greenlet tests</li>

<li>organize my ipython scripts</li>
</ul>
