<p>Enjoying Guido&#8217;s blog this fine Sunday mountain morning, came across a Python &#8216;dirty little secret&#8217;. Looking for a good test to evaluate a Python programmer&#8217;s skills? Ask them what the following would do.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'>    <span class='n'>x</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='s'>&#39;hello&#39;</span>
    <span class='n'>a</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='p'>[</span><span class='n'>x</span> <span class='k'>for</span> <span class='n'>x</span> <span class='ow'>in</span> <span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>2</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>3</span><span class='p'>]</span>
    <span class='k'>print</span> <span class='n'>x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>&#8220;What version of python?&#8221; - because python2/python3 are, well different.</p>

<p>A straightforward answer would be &#8216;hello&#8217;, because scope variables shouldn&#8217;t leak outside their scope. Of course this wouldn&#8217;t be very interesting if Python were perfect, because python 2 had this leaky behavior.</p>

<p>But what if the programmer was clever and asked whether it was being run in Py2 or Py3, and you answered Python 3? Their reply should be&#8230; <em>syntax error</em></p>

<p>Why? Because the list in the list comphrenesion needs explicit ()&#8217;s and print is now a formal function, and also needs explicit ()&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Okay, so say we fix those basic syntax errors in Python 3. Now what? Answer == <em>hello</em></p>

<p>Then if you answer Python 2, the answer is 3.</p>

<p>First, it would be good to</p>
