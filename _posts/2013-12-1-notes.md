Enjoying Guido's blog this fine Sunday mountain morning, came across a Python 'dirty little secret'. Looking for a good test to evaluate a Python programmer's skills? Ask them what the following would do.

{% highlight python %}
    x = 'hello'
    a = [x for x in 1, 2, 3]
    print x
{% endhighlight %}

 "What version of python?" - because python2/python3 are, well different. 

A straightforward answer would be 'hello', because scope variables shouldn't leak outside their scope. Of course this wouldn't be very interesting if Python were perfect, because python 2 had this leaky behavior. 

But what if the programmer was clever and asked whether it was being run in Py2 or Py3, and you answered Python 3? Their reply should be... *syntax error*

Why? Because the list in the list comphrenesion needs explicit ()'s and print is now a formal function, and also needs explicit ()'s. 

Okay, so say we fix those basic syntax errors in Python 3. Now what? Answer == *hello*

Then if you answer Python 2, the answer is 3.

First, it would be good to
