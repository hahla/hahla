recently i started using mixture to build a [site for my gf](http://tine.ms.mixture.io). it's pretty simple and cute.

But at the same time I was doing some angular work and wanted to use grunt, yo and bower: 
* ha, markdown won't create a li for the next item without this existing
* [angularjs + grunt + yo + bower ist rad](http://www.sitepoint.com/kickstart-your-angularjs-development-with-yeoman-grunt-and-bower/)

wtfnote to self re markdown: funny that "some angular work\n\* blah..." didn't result in an unordered list being started, but "work\n\n" did. This is inconsistent with 
note to self: brackets are weird in markdown. hurrah

* angular-leaflet: https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet
* http://heldr.github.io/bower-components/
* http://underscorejs.org/#

then i recalled a mental note to test out jekyll also. and hence this, an experiment with jekyll. which in turn brings me to yaml and markdown. yet more random shit.

then i came across mixture simple mode and thought to give it a spin considering i paid for it... 

* [run jekyll and mixture](http://benjamin.parry.is/writing/running-jekyll-with-mixture/)
* [run jekyll and livereload](http://thanpol.as/jekyll/jekyll-and-livereload-flow/)

thoughts on mixture simple mode w/jekyll or grunt projects...
* it does minification and pre-processing, which is nice. But frankly who cares for a blog? 
* mixture is unable to do live-refresh, which suddenly seems like the only thing I'd care about. 
* result: not sure it's worth the overhead

Okay, so here are some actually interesting things
* es6 harmony - generators http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators
* monkey patching generators http://bjouhier.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/bringing-asyncawait-to-life-in-javascript/

Did I tell you that test coverage tools are amazing?
* [like coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
* wonder if there's a [gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com/) for pip? found a mention for bundlescout, but it seems [down](http://www.bundlescout.com/)

Programming quiz -
* Create a page hosted at http://x/, that shows a red background color if an external site (http://y/) is unavilable (anything other than 200 response), or a green background if the external site is up. Do it without a backend server.
